## About This Repository

This repository contains a collection of N8N workflows that I've created and found useful in my daily work. Each workflow is stored in its own directory with detailed documentation on how to set it up and use it.

### 🎉 Latest Achievement
The **Telegram to Ollama AI Bot** is now fully functional! It's a complete self-hosted AI chatbot that runs locally with no cloud costs.

## New: Telegram to Ollama AI Bot (Starter - Public)

This is a public, non-AI starter version of the Telegram to Ollama AI Bot. It lets anyone set up a Telegram bot using n8n, but instead of AI replies, it sends a promotional message about the full version.

- **No AI or Ollama integration**
- **No coding required**
- **Perfect for testing, demos, and sharing with your audience**
- **Step-by-step setup for non-technical users**
